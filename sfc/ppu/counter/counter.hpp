//PPUcounter emulates the H/V latch counters of the S-PPU2.
//
//real hardware has the S-CPU maintain its own copy of these counters that are
//updated based on the state of the S-PPU Vblank and Hblank pins. emulating this
//would require full lock-step synchronization for every clock tick.
//to bypass this and allow the two to run out-of-order, both the CPU and PPU
//classes inherit PPUcounter and keep their own counters.
//the timers are kept in sync, as the only differences occur on V=240 and V=261,
//based on interlace. thus, we need only synchronize and fetch interlace at any
//point before this in the frame, which is handled internally by this class at
//V=128.
